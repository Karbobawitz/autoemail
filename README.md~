Desc: Instructions for setting up autoemail.sh and associated python files. 
This guide will likely not give you sufficient information to make substantial 
edits to how the code works, but it should be enough for ou to get the code 
working and if you want to make changes the comments + google should prevent 
that from being too difficult.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the README for autoemail.sh (and its subsidiary code). If you're
reading this then you have found the code, which is good. This Readme should
be in a folder named "autoemail" along with four peices of code: autoemail.sh,
FOHemail.py, TOemail-week.py and TOemail-day.py. autoemail.sh is the primary
bash script which in turn runs the two python codes (which in turn write and 
run more bash script). For the code to work you need to do three things: 
create the correct file structure, update the code for you and your employees, 
and setup the code to run automatically. The following sections will discuss 
these steps in more detail, but if all else fails you can reach out to 
Alexander Karbo at alexanderkarbo@gmail.com.

1) FILE ARCHITECTURE

This code uses hard pathing to make it more stable. You will need to change
part of the pathing in step 2 anyway, so if you're comfortable with terminal
you can skip this step and just configure your pathing as needed. It is,
however, promabably simplest to just use this file structure:

/Users/*yourusername*/autoemail/

aka your home folder: 

~/autoemail/

If you're not familiar with Terminal then the simplest thing is probably just
to move the folder "autoemail" into your home folder. If you search for your
username it will bring up your home folder (this folder probably has a house
as its icon). If you don't have the folder then you can create one with the
name "autoemail" verbatim. As long as it has the three peices of code in it
and is located in your home folder you're done!

If you don't have all of the three peices of code (your predecessor really 
should have given them to you via email or thumbdrive or something) there are
a few things you can try to fix that.

The simplest fix would be if the backup site Karbo created is still there. Try
the command:

cp -r /backup/autoemail/ ~/

This will try to copy the autoemail folder (and recursively all of the files it
contains) to your home folder. If this works then you're done with step 1!

If this does not work then the either your syntax is wrong (check your spelling
because every letter and capitalization matters) or the backup is no longer
there. If this doesn't work, fret not! The files are on github.

Ok so if you haven't used github before I don't think I can explain everything
about it here.. but the short version is that the files are stored online. Head
to this link: https://github.com/Karbobawitz/autoemail and download the files.
Once downloaded make sure you have all of the code in a folder named 
"autoemail" in your home folder.
